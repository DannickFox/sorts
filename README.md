# sorts
Sorting algorithms in C. Just for practice and fun.

Compile with: gcc -o sorting main.c sorts.c

Run in console. With no arguments the program will generate a default array
and use the default set function for sorting. Test other sorts by adding the
array size as first argument and the name of the sort to use as the second.
Available options are: bubble, insertion, selection, quick, quickLR, merge and bogo.
